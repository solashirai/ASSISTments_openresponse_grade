239593,1653678,9219,390629,703331,1054352,Explain how you know.,0.75,The reason why I said no is because that when I was comparing the seconds I saw that Tillman was faster because when I divided 19.678 by 5 I got 3.94  for the unit rate while when I got the unit rate for Lightning I got 8.34 as a unit rate,"Nanayaa, you want unit rate in meters per second, so meters has to be the numerator.

485319,1874848,29548,451268,830562,1383722,Are the two ratios you determined equivalent? Explain why or why not.,0.0,No because Im sorry Yiana i just don't understand this question,Ratios are equivalent if they are the same in their most reduced form.  4:6 can be reduced to 2:3 so 4:6 is an equivalent ratio of 2:3.  So is 6:9 equivalent to 2:3.  Can you think of more ratios equivalent to 2:3?
485319,1874848,29549,451266,830674,1423460,Explain.,0.0,The reason why she doesn't have enough is because for every 3 eggs   you need 2 cups of sugar so you do 6 divided by 2 since she brought 6 cups sugar which gets 3. Then you use the 3 to multiply with the  cups of eggs to get 9 which is not higher or up to 12.,
485319,1874848,29551,451274,830667,1383741,Explain your answer.,0.0,"this answer made sense because if they were able to reach the same exact number of trees but just in different trees since the amount of oaks got bigger. Since there are 132 oak trees and for every 3 maples there are 11 oak if you x 11 by 12 it is 132 and you have to do that for maples and 3 x 12 is 36. After that you add 132 by 36 which is 168. After that you see what it was like before the bugs and for every 9 maple trees there was 5 oak. Then you have to find out which 2 numbers = 168. The to answers are 108 maple trees and 60 oak trees. Next now that you know how much maples there was which is 108 and now how much there is which is 36 you subtract. You get 106. Thats your answer.

However she needs to have 4 cookies if she needs 12 eggs. First we can do 12/3=4. So we know now to do 4*2=8. The ratio is 12:8. But if there is only 6 cups of sugar, we could do 3*3 and 2*3 which gives the ratio 9:6. This is not enough because this would only make 3 cookies. Therefore Maritza does not have enough sugar.  ",

485319,1874848,29586,451266,830668,1383742,Explain your answer.,1.0,I got the answer by doing 18*3 since 18 is equivalent to 2. Which got me 54 and then I had to add 54 with 9 because 2 can't get to six without a decimal. I divided 18 by 2 to get the 9 and added that with 54 to get 63. Now we can tell that we can use the 9 to multiply by 8 since the ratio of this year was 2 to 7 so that means that last year  for middle school was 9. you multiply that with 8 to get how many high school students came last year which was 72.Then minus 72 with 64 to get 9 which is how many fewer high school students were in the band this year then last year.,

For Legend it was 12 gallons of gas for every 216 miles. However for Supreme it was 12 gallons of gas for every 200 miles. So Legend gets more miles per gallon of gas. To check my answer I found the unit rates for Legend and Supreme. 72/4=18 so the ratio for Legend is 18 miles for every 1 gallon of gas. For Supreme I did 50/3=16.67 therefore the ratio is 16.67 miles for every 1 gallon of gas. This is why Victor should buy Legend. ,Very nice work
